The power of these arms vary, but they can stop normal bullets and deflect some others. The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range. <br><br>\nThe tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older. As children, their violence stems from a certain playfulness, unlike the absolute hatred of humans in their later years. Diclonii are rare, as they are the members of their species that are able to reproduce naturally. <br><br>\nSilpelits are more common. They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or where they await execution for being too dangerous. <br><br>\nThe main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta. <br><br>\nHowever, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race. If Lucy is found and he manages to do so, humanity will be nonexistent. <br><br>\nKouta and Lucy's lives have been intertwined since their childhood, but not necessarily in a good way. And after the virus is airborne and spread across all of Japan, what is the fate of humanity and who holds all of the answers? <br><br>\n<i>Note: Chapter count includes 6 extras.</i>","startDate":{"year":2002,"month":6,"day":6},"endDate":{"year":2005,"month":8,"day":25},"format":"MANGA","status":"FINISHED","source":null,"chapters":113,"volumes":12,"coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/933-KbrldlVsrfxl.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/933-KbrldlVsrfxl.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/small/933-KbrldlVsrfxl.jpg","color":"#e49343"},"genres":["Action","Drama","Horror","Psychological","Romance","Supernatural"],"popularity":14955,"favourites":446}}},

Yaiba lives with his father, Kenjurou, in the forest. One day, while Yaiba was eating, a troop of gorillas came to attack. Yaiba and his father escaped and hid inside a box, but they didn't know that the box was full of pineapples and was going to be transported into the city. In the city, Yaiba finds out that he is a legendary warrior and has to fight the evil of a demonic looking high-school student named Takeshi.<br><br>\nYaiba adapted as an anime series that ran over 50 episodes, and encompassed the adventures Yaiba had in the first few runs of the manga. The show begins with Yaiba training to become a samurai in the jungle with his father and his two animal friends, Kagetora and Shonosuke. At a pivotal point, Yaiba's father announces that he is ready to return to Japan, and instructs him to find his old friend and rival, who just happens to be Sayaka's father.<br><br>\nThe people that Yaiba meets along his journey to become a true samurai encourage him, train him, or inspire him to greatness, though at heart he is still a child, and his incredible skill with a sword is matched only by his kindness towards his friends. Though, he tends to leap before he looks, and his thick-headedness tends to turn potential allies into enemies, though his friends soon clobber him, and salvage the situation. This unlikely group embarks on a host of incredible adventures where they meet legendary figures from Japanese history, and finally overcome impossible odds, and put everything on the line, to save the entire planet from a threat not of this world.

Other than being a \"retired Italian Air Force pilot\", Porco's past is not in the story, so there is no conflict with the fascist government, although the rise of fascism and the sentiment against it are mentioned. Gina doesn't appear at all, and Porco is basically a happy guy. Still, the basic story line and its charm are carried over into the anime.<br><br>\nIn the air battle scene between Porco and Donald Chuck (Curtis in the anime version), Miyazaki wrote; \"If this were animation, I might be able to convey the grandeur of this life-or-death battle.

While cleaning out the temple storage, Ushio accidentally unseals the chamber which Tora was trapped in. Initially, Ushio wisely refused to remove the spear pinning Tora (とら, Japanese for tiger) down, as Tora unwisely makes the strategic blunder of mentioning that the first thing he would do upon being freed would be to devour Ushio; but Tora's unsealed presence attracts various demons to the premises, and Ushio is forced to free Tora in exchange for his help. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life and gobble up Ushio.<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> Won the Seiun Award for Best Comic of the Year in 1997.<br>It also received the Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen in 1992.","startDate":{"year":1990,"month":2,"day":10},"endDate":{"year":1996,"month":10,"day":9},"format":"MANGA","status":"FINISHED","source":"ORIGINAL","chapters":313,"volumes":33,"coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx37747-vNjKGKR9BBmy.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/bx37747-vNjKGKR9BBmy.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/small/bx37747-vNjKGKR9BBmy.jpg","color":"#e4865d"},"genres":["Comedy","Supernatural"],"popularity":2745,"favourites":81}}},

According to myth, the evil emperor Miroku will be dethroned by a young hero who's also destined to open the gateway that connects the human world to the legendary land of Agalta. When a son with tremendous powers was born to Miroku, the infant's body was cut up into eight parts to prevent the prophecy from becoming true and given to Miroku's eight evil generals for safekeeping. Then the poor baby was cast into the river but luckily was found by Tatara who gave it both its name, Madara and artificial limbs to compensate for the missing ones. Madara grew up with a girl named Kirin and when he was 15, he was given the sword Kusanagi and told to go and get his real body parts back. Along the way, he discovers the truth about his father, his lineage and his own powers. Madara also finds out that there are 3 other contenders for this prophesized hero role: Kaos, Seishinja and his own older twin brother, Kage-ou. So the series is about Madara's adventures to bring down Miroku and his final decision when he reaches the legendary portals. <br><br>\n[Source: PRISM] <br>","startDate":{"year":1987,"month":null,"day":null},"endDate":{"year":1990,"month":null,"day":null},"format":"MANGA","status":"FINISHED","source":"OTHER","chapters":null,"volumes":4,"coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/b34035-klRLwERttuCs.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/b34035-klRLwERttuCs.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/small/b34035-klRLwERttuCs.jpg","color":"#e4785d"},"genres":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"popularity":233,"favourites":2}}},
