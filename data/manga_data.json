The power of these arms vary, but they can stop normal bullets and deflect some others. The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range. <br><br>\nThe tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older.

They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or where they await execution for being too dangerous. <br><br>\nThe main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta. <br><br>\nHowever, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race.

Like other mangas in this series, \"Hikoutei Jidai\" is a manifestation of his love for old planes.

Other than being a \"retired Italian Air Force pilot\", Porco's past is not in the story, so there is no conflict with the fascist government, although the rise of fascism and the sentiment against it are mentioned. Gina doesn't appear at all, and Porco is basically a happy guy. Still, the basic story line and its charm are carried over into the anime.<br><br>\nIn the air battle scene between Porco and Donald Chuck (Curtis in the anime version), Miyazaki wrote; \"If this were animation, I might be able to convey the grandeur of this life-or-death battle. But this is a comic. I have no choice but to rely on the imagination of you, good readers.\" No one knew at that time, that we were going to be able to see this scene on the big screen as the animated movie \"Porco Rosso\".<br><br>\n(Source: nausicaa.net)","startDate":{"year":1989,"month":null,"day":null},"endDate":{"year":null,"month":null,"day":null},"format":"MANGA","status":"FINISHED","source":null,"chapters":3,"volumes":1,"coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx54979-dCobLcVjOou5.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/bx54979-dCobLcVjOou5.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/small/bx54979-dCobLcVjOou5.jpg","color":"#d6a178"},"bannerImage":null,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"popularity":426,"favourites":4}}},

While cleaning out the temple storage, Ushio accidentally unseals the chamber which Tora was trapped in. Initially, Ushio wisely refused to remove the spear pinning Tora (とら, Japanese for tiger) down, as Tora unwisely makes the strategic blunder of mentioning that the first thing he would do upon being freed would be to devour Ushio; but Tora's unsealed presence attracts various demons to the premises, and Ushio is forced to free Tora in exchange for his help. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life and gobble up Ushio.<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> Won the Seiun Award for Best Comic of the Year in 1997.<br>It also received the Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen in 1992.","startDate":{"year":1990,"month":2,"day":10},"endDate":{"year":1996,"month":10,"day":9},"format":"MANGA","status":"FINISHED","source":"ORIGINAL","chapters":313,"volumes":33,"coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx37747-vNjKGKR9BBmy.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/bx37747-vNjKGKR9BBmy.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/small/bx37747-vNjKGKR9BBmy.jpg","color":"#e4865d"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/banner/37747-RNH2nVFy4Sp7.jpg","genres":["Comedy","Supernatural"],"popularity":2796,"favourites":82}}},

The American color TV industry has already suffered such a fate. The villain, Mr. Tsugawa, calls Kudo a wimp and sees a splendid opportunity for union busting. Will our hero prevail?<br><br>\nThus begins the first episode of this rollicking yet incisive introduction to the world economy from the Japanese point of view. Other episodes treat the appreciation of the yen, the impact of the 1970s oil shocks, deficit financing, the internationalization of business and banking, and the post-industrial future of Japan and the Pacific Rim.<br><br>\nThe book is an English edition of volume 1 of Manga Nihon keizai nyumon, originally published in 1986 by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese equivalent of the Wall Street Journal. It is based on a serious introductory text put out by the newspaper and is packed with informative charts and facts. When the comic book was first published in Japan, it was an immediate best-seller, selling over 550,000 copies in less than a year.<br><br>\nThe stories in the book reflect Japan's national mood during the \"Japanese miracle\" and into the 1980s economic bubble: apprehension and optimism jostle one another, and there is a sense of national self-pity. The book also reflects a deep suspicion of politics and bureaucrats. The prime minister appears more worried about his government's popularity than about taking the right economic course. Ultimately, the employees at Toyosan Motors demonstrate that the success of the Japanese economy will not depend on natural resources or politics but on business practices that are ethical, socially responsible, and forward-looking (Univ. of California Press).","startDate":{"year":1988,"month":5,"day":10},"endDate":{"year":1996,"month":12,"day":1},"format":"MANGA","status":"FINISHED","source":null,"chapters":null,"volumes":2,"coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/32715.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/32715.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/small/32715.jpg","color":"#e4e435"},"bannerImage":null,"genres":["Slice of Life"],"popularity":67,"favourites":0}}},
